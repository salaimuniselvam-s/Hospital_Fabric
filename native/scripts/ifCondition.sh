# In a shell script, conditional statements often use comparison operators to test values. Here's a breakdown of some common comparison operators and their meanings:

# -n: This operator tests whether a string is non-empty. It returns true if the string is not empty, and false otherwise.

# -z: This operator tests whether a string is empty. It returns true if the string is empty, and false otherwise.

# -eq: This operator tests whether two values are equal. It returns true if the values are equal, and false otherwise. This operator is typically used to compare numerical values.

# -ne: This operator tests whether two values are not equal. It returns true if the values are not equal, and false otherwise.

# -gt: This operator tests whether one value is greater than another. It returns true if the first value is greater than the second, and false otherwise. This operator is typically used to compare numerical values.

# -lt: This operator tests whether one value is less than another. It returns true if the first value is less than the second, and false otherwise. This operator is typically used to compare numerical values.

# -ge: This operator tests whether one value is greater than or equal to another. It returns true if the first value is greater than or equal to the second, and false otherwise. This operator is typically used to compare numerical values.

# -le: This operator tests whether one value is less than or equal to another. It returns true if the first value is less than or equal to the second, and false otherwise. This operator is typically used to compare numerical values.

# When using the if statement in a shell script, you can use these comparison operators to test values and perform different actions based on the results. For example, you might use the -eq operator to test whether a variable is equal to a specific value, or the -n operator to test whether a string is non-empty.
